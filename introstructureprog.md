-Declarative:
In computer science, declarative programming is a
programming paradigm a style of building the structure and elements of computer
programs that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control
flow. 

-Functional Programming: 
Functional programming is a programming paradigm in which we 
try to bind everything in pure mathematical functions style.
It is a declarative type of programming style.

-DataFlow: 
In computer programming, dataflow programming is a paradigm that models a 
program as a directed graph of the data flowing between operations, thus implementing 
dataflow principles and architecture.
 
 -Functional (declarative): 
Physicists, mathematicians, and chemists think in terms of equations and functions, they define solutions to     problems as answers to equations and functions. The functional paradigm works this way: you program an answer to a problem with           equational functions that read an input and calculate an output. ``Variables'' are like the ones in algebra, not like the ones in         Fortran or C.
 
 -Logic:
Logic programming is a computer programming paradigm in which program statements express facts and rules about problems within a system of formal logic. Rules are written as logical clauses with a head and a body; for instance, "H is true if B1, B2, and B3 are true." Facts are expressed similar to rules, but without a body; for instance, "H is true."  Some logic programming languages, such as Datalog and ASP (Answer Set Programming), are purely declarative. They allow for statements about what the program should accomplish, with no explicit step-by-step instructions on how to do so. Others, such as Prolog, are a combination of declarative and imperative. They may also include procedural statements, such as "To solve H, solve B1, B2, and B3."

-Constraint-based:
Constraint programming is a powerful paradigm for solving combinatorial search problems that draws on a wide range of techniques from artificial intelligence, operations research, algorithms, graph theory and elsewhere. The basic idea in constraint programming is that the user states the constraints and a general purpose constraint solver is used to solve them.
Constraints are just relations, and a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) states which relations should hold among the given decision variables. More formally, a constraint satisfaction problem consists of a set of variables, each with some domain of values, and a set of relations on subsets of these variables.

-Template-based:
Templates are the foundation of generic programming, which involves writing code in a way that is independent of any particular type.
A template is a blueprint or formula for creating a generic class or a function. The library containers like iterators and algorithms are examples of generic programming and have been developed using template concept.

-Structured:
Structured programming is a program written with only the structured programming constructions:  Sequence: Lines or blocks of code are written and executed in sequential order. Repetition: Repeat a block of code (Action) while a condition is true. There is no limit to the number of times that the block can be executed. Selection: Execute a block of code (Action) if a condition is true. The block of code is executed at most once. 
Some characteristics are: The code should be in modular nature, there should be single entry and single exit for each module (i.e. no unconditional gates). At least one construct each for sequence, condition and iteration.

-Imperative: 
Imperative programming is a paradigm of computer programming in which the program describes a sequence of steps that change the state of the computer. Unlike declarative programming, which describes "what" a program should accomplish, imperative programming explicitly tells the computer "how" to accomplish it. Programs written this way often compile to binary executables that run more efficiently since all CPU instructions are themselves imperative statements.
To make programs simpler for a human to read and write, imperative statements can be grouped into sections known as code blocks.
In the 1950s, the idea of grouping a program's code into blocks was first implemented in the ALGOL programming language. They were originally called "compound statements," but today these blocks of code are known as procedures. Once a procedure is defined, it can be used as a single imperative statement, abstracting the control flow of a program and allowing the developer to express programming ideas more naturally. This type of imperative programming is called procedural programming, and it is a step towards higher-level abstractions such as declarative programming.

-Von Neumann: 
A von Neumann language is any of those programming languages that are high-level abstract isomorphic copies of von Neumann architectures. As of 2009, most current programming languages fit into this.

-Interpreted (Scripting):  In an interpreted language, the source code is not directly translated by the target machine. Instead, a different program, aka the interpreter, reads and executes the code.
Interpreters run through a program line by line and execute each command. Here, if the author decides he wants to use a different kind of olive oil, he could scratch the old one out and add the new one. Your translator friend can then convey that change to you as it happens.
Interpreted languages were once significantly slower than compiled languages. But, with the development of just-in-time compilation, that gap is shrinking.
Examples of common interpreted languages are PHP, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript.

-Object-oriented	
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based upon objects (having both data and methods) that aims to incorporate the advantages of modularity and reusability. Objects, which are usually instances of classes, are used to interact with one another to design applications and computer programs.
The important features of object–oriented programming are:
	•Bottom–up approach in program design
	•Programs organized around objects, grouped in classes
	•Focus on data with methods to operate upon object’s data
	•Interaction between objects through functions
	•Reusability of design through creation of new classes by adding features to existing classes

Some examples of object-oriented programming languages are C++, Java, Smalltalk, Delphi, C#, Perl, Python, Ruby, and PHP.
