-Declarative:
In computer science, declarative programming is a
programming paradigm a style of building the structure and elements of computer
programs that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control
flow. 

-Functional Programming: 
Functional programming is a programming paradigm in which we 
try to bind everything in pure mathematical functions style.
It is a declarative type of programming style.

-DataFlow: 
In computer programming, dataflow programming is a paradigm that models a 
program as a directed graph of the data flowing between operations, thus implementing 
dataflow principles and architecture.
 
 -Functional (declarative): 
Physicists, mathematicians, and chemists think in terms of equations and functions, they define solutions to     problems as answers to equations and functions. The functional paradigm works this way: you program an answer to a problem with           equational functions that read an input and calculate an output. ``Variables'' are like the ones in algebra, not like the ones in         Fortran or C.
 
 -Logic:
 Logic programming is a computer programming paradigm in which program statements express facts and rules about problems within a system of formal logic. Rules are written as logical clauses with a head and a body; for instance, "H is true if B1, B2, and B3 are true." Facts are expressed similar to rules, but without a body; for instance, "H is true."  Some logic programming languages, such as Datalog and ASP (Answer Set Programming), are purely declarative. They allow for statements about what the program should accomplish, with no explicit step-by-step instructions on how to do so. Others, such as Prolog, are a combination of declarative and imperative. They may also include procedural statements, such as "To solve H, solve B1, B2, and B3."
